# JurisAide Benin Project

Plateforme de gestion du pèlerinage à La Mecque (Hadj) pour le Bénin.

This is the app project template structure using FastAPI.
This template is based on the following technologies:

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web framework
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) as database
- [Beanie](https://roman-right.github.io/beanie/) as ODM
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) as testing framework
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for workflow automation


## 🔨 Installing

### Python 3.9

Before getting started, ensure that [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/) is installed on your computer.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-oriented database that use JSON-like documents to store data.
You will need to install MongoDB 6.0 [locally](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
or sign up for a free hosted one with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing).
Once you install MongoDB, make sure to create a database.

### Steps

Clone the repo and open a terminal at the root of the cloned repo.

Before getting started, make sure you have installed virtualenv on your device:

Install virtualenv

```shell
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
```

1. Setup a virtual env. Only do this on your first run.

```shell
virtualenv .venv --python=python3.12
```

2. Activate the virtualenv

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install all dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

5. Init environment variables. Duplicate the env template file:

```shell
cp ./.env.tpl ./.env
```

Open `.env` file with a text editor and update the env vars as needed

6. Load metadata, from metadata.yml:

```shell
python register.py
```

7. Run migrations:

```shell
python migrate.py
```

## 🖌 Formatting

Keep in mind that those are automated formatting assistant tools.
They will not always give the best result, as they just apply
rules blindly. As a developer you still have the responsibility to
ensure that the code is formatted with perfection.

- Use black to format the code
  From the project root run:

```shell
black .
```

- Use isort to sort the import
  From the project root run:

```shell
isort .
```

## 🧽 Linting

Linters are useful to ensure that your code quality matches with standards.

- Running pre-commit on the project to run all linters.

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

- Use pylint to check for common mistakes.
  From the project root, run:

```shell
pylint AppMain app tests
```

- Use mypy to check for typing issues.
  From the project root, run:

```shell
mypy .
```

- Use pydocstyle to check for documentation issues.
  From the project root, run:

```shell
pydocstyle .
```

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are run using the pytest library.
From the project root, run:

```shell
pytest
```

To test a specific testcase:

```shell
pytest -sv path_to_test_file::test_name
```

With the -sv option, you get the logs (everything printed with print() will be displayed directly) and the test names will be displayed in the console, followed by their status.

e.g:

```shell
pytest -sv tests/webapi/ressources/test_ressources.py::test_listing
```
